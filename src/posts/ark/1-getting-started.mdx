# Getting Started with Python

Hi! If you're viewing this, you probably came from

<span class="bg-gradient-to-r from-teal-600 to-emerald-700 bg-clip-text text-transparent">Mr. Arkiletian</span>'s course! I'm 
<Link external href="https://github.com/piemot" class="bg-gradient-to-r from-teal-600 to-emerald-700 bg-clip-text text-transparent">Pierson</Link>,
and I put this website together to give you an alternative to Mr. Ark's videos. 
I graduated from Hamber last year, and I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Victoria.

## What you need

The essential things you need for this course are the <span class="size-6 inline-block align-middle"><PyLogo class="h-full w-full block" /></span> Python interpreter
and the <span class="size-6 inline-block align-middle"><GeLogo class="h-full w-full block" /></span> Geany software editor (or another editor, if you already have experience).

<Callout type="warning" title="Please don't use another editor unless you:">
  <ol>
    <li class="!mt-0">are 100% sure you won't need help with fixing things, or</li>
    <li>have another good reason to.</li>
  </ol>
  Using an editor instructors are unfamiliar with makes it a lot harder for them to help you.
</Callout>

## Install Python

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    There are two ways to install Python on Windows. Mr. Ark recommends installing it natively, but downloading WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) 
    gives you an environment more similar to what you'll be working on in school. Either way will work; you can select your preferred option below.
    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Ark">
        **Check if Python is already installed**

        1. Open **PowerShell**.
            <Callout type="help" title="How do I open PowerShell?" >
              1. Press the <Kbd shortcut="Win" /> key, to open up the **Start** menu,
              1. Type `PowerShell`, and
              1. Press <Kbd shortcut="Enter" />.
            </Callout>
        1. Type `py --version` into your PowerShell window,
          then press <Kbd shortcut="Enter" /> to run the command.
        1. PowerShell should show something like:
            ```powershell title="PowerShell" {2}
            PS> py --version
            Python 3.x.y
            ```
        1. If you see this output, great! You're done with this segment.
          Otherwise, you'll need to continue on and install Python on your computer.

        **Install Python**

        1. Navigate to the [Downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) of [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
        1. Press the button to "<kbd class="bg-amber-300/40">Download Python 3.13.5</kbd>", or a newer version if it exists.
        1. Run the downloaded file.
        1. Ensure the <samp>Add python.exe to PATH</samp> checkbox is selected.
        1. Press <kbd>Install Now</kbd>.
            <Callout type="warning" title="If you need to customize the installation, make sure you enable these settings:">
            - [x] Install `py` launcher
            - [x] Install documentation
            - [x] Associate files with Python
            - [x] Add Python to environment variables
            </Callout>
        1. You're done! Close PowerShell, then re-open it and enter in the `py --version` command again.
          This time, you should see the correct output.

  <TabItem label="Mac">
    The easiest way to install most development-related utilities on Mac is via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

    Open the **Terminal** app. You can do this by navigating to <span class="font-semibold inline-flex items-center">Applications <ChevronRightIcon class="size-5" /> Utilities</span>
    in Finder, or by searching the **Launchpad**.

    Paste this command:
    ```sh title="Homebrew Installer"
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```
    into the Terminal, then press <Kbd shortcut="Enter" />.
    It may request your password; if it does, enter it (you won't be able to see it as you type)
    and press <Kbd shortcut="Enter" /> again.

    Homebrew will list what it intends to install, and ask that you press <Kbd shortcut="Enter" /> to continue.

    Once Homebrew is installed, you can run `brew install python` in the Terminal to ask Homebrew to install Python 3.
    Once Python is installed, run `python --version` to verify it works.
    You should see
    ```sh title="Terminal" {2}
    $ python --version
    Python 3.x.y
    ```

## Install Geany

If you already have a code editor installed on your system, you can skip this step.
In theory, any text-processing software will work (_please_ don't try to use Microsoft Word),
but Geany gives you the benefit of syntax highlighting, hotkeys, and easy-to-install themes.

<CollapsibleCallout title="What other editing options do I have?">
  Personally, I tend to use [`vim`](https://vim.org) because it's 
  pre-installed on nearly every device you'll ever need to use.
  Unfortunately, because it's keyboard-only (you can't use the mouse for __anything__),
  it can be very difficult to learn to navigate. If you want to try it out, 
  just type `vim` <Kbd shortcut="Enter" /> in a console on a Mac or Linux device.

  **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)**, or _VSCode_ for short, is the de-facto editor of most
  modern programmers because of its massive ecosystem of extensions. Backed by Microsoft, it can do
  pretty much anything you need, but its features can make it difficult to understand what's going on
  behind the scenes.

  **Other options I'd recommend:**

  - [Zed](https://zed.dev), a newer VSCode-inspired editor written in Rust, giving it massive performance benefits

</CollapsibleCallout>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    Geany's downloads can be found at [geany.org/download/releases](https://geany.org/download/releases/).
    
    1. Select the `geany-2.1_setup.exe` file next to **Windows (64-bit)** to start the download.
    1. Open your **Downloads** folder, and double-click `geany-2.1_setup` to launch the installer.
    1. Click through the installer, leaving all the settings as they are by default.
    1. Launch Geany by opening the Start menu and selecting <samp>Geany</samp>.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Mac">
    Geany's downloads can be found at [geany.org/download/releases](https://geany.org/download/releases/).
      
    1. Select either the `geany-2.1_osx.dmg`, or the `geany-2.1_osx_arm64.dmg` file next to **macOS** to start the download.
        <Callout type="help" title="Which file should I pick?">
          The two files are built for different architectures: the `x86_64` and the `ARM64` architecture.

          The architecture of a computer refers to how the chip works internally.
          Specifically, chips Intel manufactured for older Apple devices run `x86` programs,
          and Apple Silicon (also known as M1, M2, or other M-series) chips they started
          to manufacture in-house in 2020 run `ARM` programs.

          Therefore, the file to pick depends on your computer.
          | | |
          | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
          | ARM (Apple Silicon M1, M2, etc) | `geany-2.1_osx_arm64.dmg` |
          | Intel (Intel Core i5, i7, etc)  | `geany-2.1_osx.dmg`       |

          You can check your chip by clicking on the ï£¿ logo in the top-left corner of your screen,
          selecting <samp>About This Mac</samp>, and checking the value of **Processor**.
        </Callout>
    1. Open your **Downloads** folder, and double-click the `.dmg` file you selected to launch the installer.
    1. Drag-and-drop the Geany icon into the Applications folder.
    1. Launch Geany by opening the app.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configure Geany

To test whether Geany works, launch it and create a new file.
Type in the Python code shown below, and press <Kbd shortcut="Cmd + S" windows="Ctrl + S" /> to save the file.
Save the file with the name `hello-world.py`.

```py title="hello-world.py"
print("Hello, world!")
```

Once the file is saved, press <Kbd shortcut="F5" macos="Fn + F5" />. A window should open and you should see the program run.
Congratulations, you just wrote and ran your first bit of Python code on your own machine!

<Callout type="error" title="I pressed F5, but it didn't work!" >
  That's unfortunate! At the top of the screen, press 
  <span class="font-semibold inline-flex items-center">Build <ChevronRightIcon class="size-4" /> Set Build Commands</span>.
  Next to the <samp>Execute</samp> box near the bottom of the menu, replace `python3 "%f"` with `py "%f"`, press <kbd>OK</kbd>, and try again.

If that doesn't work, try opening the same menu and using `python "%f"` instead.

Remember which one of these works! If someone instructs you to use `python3`,
but you ran into this issue, try the same command with `py` or `python` instead.

</Callout>

## Make your editor colourful

You'll spend a lot of time working in the code editor, so it should look appealing to you.
Geany hosts a whole bunch of themes, shown on the [geany.org/download/themes](https://www.geany.org/download/themes/) page.

In order to enable a theme, just open Geany and press

<span class="inline-flex items-center font-semibold">View <ChevronRightIcon class="size-5" /> Change Color Scheme</span>.
Dark themes are traditional, but it's up to you.

<Callout type="info" >
  Personally, I prefer to install a theme I use on most of my editors: [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/geany/tree/main).
  To install this theme, I download the `catppuccin-frappe.conf` and `catppuccin-macchiato.conf` files from the `src` folder in the GitHub repository,
  then run this command to move them into the `.config/geany/colorschemes` folder:

  ```sh
  mkdir -p ~/.config/geany/colorschemes && mv ~/Downloads/catppuccin-{frappe,macchiato}.conf ~/.config/geany/colorschemes
  ```
