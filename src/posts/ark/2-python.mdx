Welcome to the course! Hopefully, by now, you have your editor (Geany) set up, you're able to run Python,
and you're able to open a Terminal app (or PowerShell for Windows users).

## What is Python?

According to [python.org](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb):

> Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language.

That's a lot of words you're probably not familiar with. Let's start with the simplest one:

<dl>
  <dt>Programming language</dt>
  <dd>A *programming language* is a set of instructions that lets us describe exactly 
    what we want our computers to do. In other words, a programming language is just a 
    list of steps to solve a problem, written in a way that the computer is able to read.</dd>

<dt>High-level</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    A *high-level* programming language abstracts hardware concepts away from the programmer. What this means is that
    you, as you program, don't have to worry about everything the computer is doing to make your instructions work. You
    don't have to worry about what architecture, or operating system, or filesystem the program is running on: you can
    do the same thing for any computer and it'll just work.
  </p>
  <p>
    This makes Python very similar to English. Instead of complicated symbols, you can express your wishes simillarly to
    how you'd write them in a sentence. In fact, Python is often used for "pseudo-code": writing out an algorithm in
    code that's easy to understand for both programmers and non-programmers alike.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>Interpreted</dt>
<dd>
  An *interpreted* programming language doesn't need to be *compiled*. Computers operate on bits: a whole bunch of tiny
  switches that are either set to 1 (on) or 0 (off). We call this binary, because "binary" refers to the two possible
  states a bit can be in. Put together, these bits can represent numbers, and each number maps to something the computer
  should be doing - called *machine code*.
  <Callout type="info">
    Want to learn more? Look into the **Assembly** set of programming languages - or just watch [Ben Eater's
    videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU), which are some of the best explanations of how computers work
    I've ever seen.
  </Callout>
  Many languages, like C, C++, or Rust, have to be *compiled* into machine code. Instead of that, Python runs the code
  straight from the source, which means that there's no gap between the code you write and the code that gets executed
  on the computer.
</dd>

  <dt>Object-Oriented</dt>
  <dd>We don't have to worry about what object-oriented languages mean, because most of the 
  features we'll be starting with aren't written in an object-oriented style. You'll get lots
  of experience with object-oriented programming (OOP for short) in the second class Mr. Ark 
  teaches, *Intermediate Python with FLTK*.</dd>
</dl>

There are two _major versions_ of python that are commonly used - Version 2 and Version 3.
Version 2 has been deprecated for some time, so this course is taught entirely in Python 3.

Despite this, many operating systems (particularly MacOS) install Python 2 by default,
because so much old code still relies on it.

<Callout type="info">
  The definition of **deprecated** is "to express disapproval of." In programming terms, a version or feature is
  *deprecated* if the authors no longer recommend using it. Python 2 is deprecated because Python 3 can do everything it
  could, and is _maintained_: it's consistently updated with features, bug fixes, and security patches.
</Callout>

## Playing Around

### The Python REPL

To get started with Python, open a Terminal or PowerShell window.

<Callout type="help" title="How do I open the Terminal?">
  For Windows users, press the <Kbd shortcut="Win" /> key to open up the **Start** menu and search for `PowerShell`. For
  Mac users, either open the **Launchpad** or open Spotlight Search with <Kbd shortcut="Command + Space" /> and search
  for `Terminal`.
</Callout>

The terminal is the text-based interface to your operating system. When you type something (called a _command_) into the Terminal,
you are telling the computer that you want to use a tool. Since we want to use Python 3, we run it by typing `python3`.

Commands aren't executed until you press <Kbd shortcut="Enter" />, so whenever I mention to run a command, remember to press the <Kbd shortcut="Enter" /> key afterward.

```sh title="Terminal"
$ python3
```

Running Python launches the _Python interpreter prompt_. You should see the `>>>` symbol before your cursor,
where you can start typing things. To write your first line of Python code, type `print("Hello World")`, and then press the <Kbd shortcut="Enter" /> key.

You should see your screen look somewhat like this:

```sh title="Terminal"
$ python3
Python 3.13.5 (main, Jul 23 2025, 00:30:58) [Clang 20.1.4 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello World")
Hello World
>>>
```

To exit the interpreter prompt, use the keyboard shortcut <Kbd shortcut="Ctrl + D" />.

Using the interpreter is great for short little scripts when you want to play around.
The problem with the interpreter (or REPL, read-eval-print-loop) is that when you exit it,
everything you did has been deleted. We can fix that by saving our programs to files.

Python uses the `.py` file extension, just like Word files use `.docx` or image files use `.png`.
It's a good idea to create a new folder where you can store all the files you work with in this course.

### Navigating the Filesystem

This is a great opportunity to show off what the command line can do! Instead of navigating through
pages of Finder (on Mac) or File Explorer (on Windows), we can quickly make changes to the file system
via the `ls`, `cd`, and `mkdir` commands.

So what do these commands do? Let's start with `ls`. If you enter `ls` into your terminal and hit <Kbd shortcut="Enter" />,
you'll see all the files and folders that exist in your root directory. It might look something like this:

```txt frame="terminal" title="The ls command"
$ ls
Applications/      Library/       Public/
Desktop/           Movies/
Documents/         Music/
Downloads/         Pictures/
```

The Desktop folder holds all the files you can see on your desktop.
The Downloads folder holds all the files you downloaded, and the other folders all hold similar purposes.
`ls` stands for "<span class="command-info"><span class="hl">l</span>i<span class="hl">s</span>t directory contents</span>."
A "directory" is another name for a folder in the filesystem.

To change which directory you're in, use the `cd` (<span class="command-info"><span class="hl">c</span>hange <span class="hl">d</span>irectory</span>) command.
For example, to move into your Downloads folder, type `cd Downloads`, and then type `ls` to list all the files in your Downloads.
`cd` changes your _working directory_, which refers to the directory your command-line is currently in and operating on.
To check your working directory, run `pwd` (<span class="command-info"><span class="hl">p</span>rint <span class="hl">w</span>orking <span class="hl">d</span>irectory</span>).
You should see something like:

```sh
$ pwd
/Users/piemot/Downloads
```

The root directory (in my case, `/Users/piemot`) has a special name; it can be reached via the tilde `~`.
To return to the root directory, run `cd ~`. Since this is a frequently used command, you can even skip the `~` and just run `cd`.
You can go back one directory by using `..`. Try `cd`ing into Downloads and then type `cd ..` to return to the root directory another way.

Let's make a new folder. Try running the command `mkdir sample`
(`mkdir` stands for <span class="command-info"><span class="hl">m</span>a<span class="hl">k</span>e <span class="hl">dir</span>ectory</span>),
then try running the `ls` command again. You should see the `sample` folder appear too, because `mkdir` created it.

Run `rmdir sample` to clean up (`rmdir` = <span class="command-info"><span class="hl">r</span>e<span class="hl">m</span>ove <span class="hl">dir</span>ectory</span>).

Now to make a directory for real.
Personally, I store my files under a subfolder of Documents, `~/Documents/cs1`. To create this folder, use the `mkdir` command:

```sh
$ mkdir -p Documents/cs1
```

<Callout type="info" title="Why is the `-p` there?">
  Parts of a command that start with a dash, like `-o` or `--opt` are called _flags_. Flags change the way the program
  works. For `mkdir`, the `-p` flag creates intermediate directories: if the `Documents` folder doesn't exist, mkdir
  will create it before trying to create `cs1`.
</Callout>

Getting to know these few commands will make your life so much easier. I definitely recommend playing around a little.
Note that `rmdir` only deletes empty folders, so it's pretty safe to play with.
