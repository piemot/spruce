# SpruceBytes

This is an attempt at bathering high-quality notes for various courses contributors have
been part of, tutored for, or just have knowledge on the subject!

The site is powered by Astro and TailwindCSS.

## Inspiration

I started this project when I came across [Revision Time](https://revisionti.me/), which has a very similar premise.
In designing the website, I took inspiration from
the [Stripe Documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/),
the [Discord Developer Documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs),
and the [Fumadocs framework](https://fumadocs.dev).
